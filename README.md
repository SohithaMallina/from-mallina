### SQL
This SQL snippet performs a FULL OUTER JOIN between two tables, table1 and table2, based on a common column (column_name).<br> The FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows, with NULLs in places where there is no match.<br> The WHERE clause is used to filter the results based on a specified condition. <br> This ensures that the final result includes rows that meet the condition from the joined tables.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

```
